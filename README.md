# pokemon-showdown-app

Multiplayer pokemon battle client with a native macOS UI and low-level C++ networking, I will likely end up integrating this with my Acorn UI framework with C++ and Vulkan.

Note - this is just getting started, and I am currently going to shoot for a simple MVP, being able to enter a random 6v6 battle, then I will add more features.

Connects to [Pokémon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com) — the server is open source so I can determine API endpoints and protocol compatibility. This repo may break if upstream changes their protocol, and I am the only maintainer.

- Server reference: https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown
- Protocol docs: https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md
