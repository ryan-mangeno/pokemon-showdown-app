# pokemon-showdown-app
multiplayer pokemon battle local

implements a nice interface and low level c++ networking with pokemon showdown https://pokemonshowdown.com
pokemon showdown is open sourced, so this is how I am able to detemine api endpoints and comptability, however this repo might not always be stable since
changes there will impact changes here, and I am the only maintainer for this repo
